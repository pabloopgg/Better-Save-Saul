# Better-Save-Saul
Platform game based on Better Caul Saul tv show. Basically, It is a mod from T-REX Game from chromium project, but more funny cause you can play as Jimmy Mcgill trying to cross desert as in the Bagman episode. 

Have fun and Better Call Saauuul GOODAMN!(?)


A big hug to my friend Gabriel de Oliveira, without you this project would have no life (and neither would sprinters). Thanks man.
